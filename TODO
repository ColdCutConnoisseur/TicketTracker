[ ] Problem that was overlooked during development:  Supply numbers are just the number of individual ticket listings--they don't account
    for offered quantity (i.e There may be 25 individual listers but even one of the listers might be offering 30 tickets).
    current logic will return 25 as the supply count

[ ] I would like to color format pricing and supply chart series to reflect a tick up / tick down/ unchanged (green, red, grey)
